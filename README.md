tower defence game
The main idea is to Create a Multiplayer and Competitive tower defence game.
each player will be provided with their own area within they can build their defensive structures.
each player will also be provided a way to create enemies that will "attack" opposing players defenses.
the game will resolve when one player has successfully depleted the opposing players of their life count, last player standing wins.
